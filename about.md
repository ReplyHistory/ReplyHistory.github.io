I run a Youtube channel called Reply History where I explain historical events with simple-to-follow diagrams. I started this channel in hopes of providing the basic elements of an event without the over complication that accompanies research archives or the silliness of meme videos. All work that goes into these videos is done my me so any kind of contribution is most welcome.
